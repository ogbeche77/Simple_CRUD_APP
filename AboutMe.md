## My Proudest Achievement

In recent times, one of my proudest achievement was when I came up with a solution to solve a technically challenging task at work. There is a chatlugin which has been built and some of our customers uses this chatplugin by injesting the script in an html header and they can use this functionality on their own website. But the challenge we had was to make the chatplugin adapt to the various colors/themes of the customers. I suggested to the team about a solution which I had researched about. This ensured that we did not use additional libraries or framework to solve this problem, but rather build a color selector in Typescript, then the customers can select tcolors corresponsing to their website themes. This solotion was adopted and I am proud of it

## Book recommendation

The book I can recommend is called Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software. It gives an indept of the relationship between software and hardware and also what goes on behind the hood. It also touches some aspect of networking and mechanical computiting. I found it highy enlightening and educational
